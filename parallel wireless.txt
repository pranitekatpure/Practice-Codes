Round 1:
- introduction
- questions based on resume
- difference between sockets and shared memory, when to use a particular IPC mechanism
- how will you debug if some UDP packet is lost
- TCP/IP stack
- malloc() and free()
- C++( STL )
- you have an array of integers in the range [1..n] , how will find the missing number 
- you have an array of integers in the range [1..n] , how will find the duplicate number
- print elements of linked list in reverse order
- reverse of linked list by normal method
 
Round 2:
- Brief introduction of projects
- Questions on resume
- Difference between process and thread
- What all sections are stored between thread and process
- IPC mechanism 
- demand paging 
- trashing 
- Remove duplicate elements from linked list 
	I/P: 1->2->3->3->4			
	O/P: 1->2->3->4
- Palindrome of string
- Check if this is palindrome
  I/P: {"m", "al", "aya", "lam"}


Round 3:
- Brief introduction of projects
- Questions on resume
- IPC mechanism
- Server-client implementation and related APIs
- Write a function to rotate number of bits to left, given input number and bits to rotate
	I/P: 1100 0000 0000 0000 		bits_to_rotate = 1
	O/P: 1000 0000 0000 0001
- Print elements of linked list in reverse order.
- Stack frame in detail
- Details of IP header  
- How the packet will be routed from host1 to host2
	host1 -> Router1 -> Router2 -> host2
- Memory leak and memory corruption and any tools to find these
